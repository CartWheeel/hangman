# Overview

The a simple project to demonstrate my level of understanding and experience programming in the Rust language. The game will begin and prompt for user input to guess a random word from a list. The user will have 6 wrong guesses before the game ends or they win. The program may be terminated by guessing the special character '*'.

The program includes functions, structures, and variables to display a CLI version of the game hangman. The words are saved and can be modified in the words.txt file.

I'm working to understand more programming languages to imporve my skills and abilities as I study the field of computer science.

# Development Environment

I used VScode with the Rust extension after following download instructions on the official rust website.

The project was programmed in Rust. I heavily relied on a youtube tutorial linked below for understanding. Upon completing the tutorial I made my own adjustments and changes to the functionality of the program based on what I had learned.

# Future Work

- Error detection for if user input is a number, special character, or string of letters
- Improve randomness when selecting word from words.txt
- Game menu to select difficulty of words
- Add a function to prompt "Play again"
- Keep track of letters guessed and display to inform what has been guessed or not
- Not allow player to guess same letter twice.
